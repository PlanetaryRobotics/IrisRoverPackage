## Development notes

### Clocks

TODO: Check which clocks are disabled in LPM
TODO: Consult clock section in the user guide

* MCLK is 16MHz and is the clock that drives the CPU
* SMCLK is ??? MHz (most probably 8 MHz) and is a fractional portion of MCLK.
  It ticks every "n" MCLK ticks and is usually used to drive peripherals.
* DCO is ??? MHz (16MHz? 8MHz?); the Digital Crystal Oscillator.
