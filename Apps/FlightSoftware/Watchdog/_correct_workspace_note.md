**Note:** the correct (known good) workspace to use is `v10_workspace_watchdog` on the black X1 Thinkpad at `/home/iris/mschnur/v10_workspace_watchdog`. **This does seem to matter greatly (some build settings appear not to be stored in the project but, instead, are in the workspace).** A known good version of it has been compressed and stored in `_correct_workspace_backup.zip` in case we ever have to recover its settings in a hurry.
