// from the buffer if the buffer is not empty.
//
// Either of these is safe to call in any context (in ISR or not) without needing to
// disable any interrupts.
//
// If put() is called in an interrupt and get() called outside of an interrupt, then
// these two functions can be used safely without disabling any interrupts. put() calls
// full(), which reads both the head and tail, and then may modify head. get() calls
// empty(), which reads both the head and tail, and then may modify tail. In this scenario
// calling put() is safe because it is called within the interrupt, so get() can't modify
// the head or tail while it is executed. Additionally, calling get() is safe because even
// though it *is* possible for head to be modified, this modification will only cause get()
// to not catch that a new element to be added to the buffer, but the next time get() is
// called it will be noticed.
//
// If get() is called in interrupt and put() is called outside an interrupt, then these
// functions are still safe to use. The worst thing that can happen is that during a
// a call to put(), the get() is invoked from the interrupt. In this case, the get()
// call may free a slot in the buffer, but the call to put() won't see this free slot
// and the put() call will fail to write the byte to the buffer. Similarly, the get()
// call may not see a byte in the process of being written if the put() call is interrupted,
// but it is expected that after calling put() the code should make sure that whatever
// code calls get() is invoked (i.e. by enabling the appropriate interrupt).
