 *
 * This, along with `RingBuffer__get()`, is safe to call in any context (in ISR or not) without needing to disable any
 * interrupts. This is true because of the following:
 *
 * If put() is called in an interrupt and get() called outside of an interrupt, then these two functions can be used
 * safely without disabling any interrupts. put() calls full(), which reads both the head and tail, and then may modify
 * head. get() calls empty(), which reads both the head and tail, and then may modify tail. In this scenario calling
 * put() is safe because it is called within the interrupt, so get() can't modify the head or tail while it is executed.
 * Additionally, calling get() is safe because even though it *is* possible for head to be modified, this modification
 * will only cause get() to not catch that a new element to be added to the buffer, but the next time get() is called
 * it will be noticed.
 *
 * If get() is called in interrupt and put() is called outside an interrupt, then these functions are still safe to use.
 * The worst thing that can happen is that during a a call to put(), the get() is invoked from the interrupt. In this
 * case, the get() call may free a slot in the buffer, but the call to put() won't see this free slot and the put() call
 * will fail to write the byte to the buffer. Similarly, the get() call may not see a byte in the process of being
 * written if the put() call is interrupted, but it is expected that after calling put() the code should make sure that
 * whatever code calls get() is invoked (i.e. by enabling the appropriate interrupt).
