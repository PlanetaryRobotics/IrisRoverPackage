                Turns back on and resets the state machine in Hercules managing 
                UART BGAPI communications with the WF121 Radio and stops

                        The data as a 'string', with a MAX length of 134B 
                        (4B of BGAPI header + 1B 'BGAPI uint8array' length byte 
                        + 128B of data + 1B null termination). To increase this 
                        limit, you'll likely need to bump up 
                        'FW_COM_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE' and 'FW_CMD_STRING_MAX_SIZE' 
                        in 'fprime/Fw/Cfg/Config.hpp' (read the notes there for 
                        more information about required padding). Note that 
                        increasing the max string size has a pretty big effect 
                        on the total program size in memory.
 
 
                        Here string here just means a null terminated char 
                        array. To be specific, the NULL termination is EXCLUDED 
                        from the length and does NOT need to be (and should not 
                        be) included in the data sent. That is, if length is 3, 
                        the data sent would be [0x00, 0x03, byte0, byte1, byte2] 
                        and the memory in the `CmdStringArg->m_buf` inside 
                        Hercules would look like: [byte0, byte1, byte2, NULL].
