                ensuring all packets in a programming sequence are uplinked 
                correctly and in the correct order).
 
                Technically it's a bit hacky to just have three args with 
                manually synced enums and, instead, this should be using an 
                FPrime Array of custom serializables but we don't have that 
                serialization built in our GDS and don't have time to add it 
                since it would be non-trivial.
