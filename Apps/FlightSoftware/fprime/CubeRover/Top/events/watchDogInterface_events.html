             GSW GDS will split this out into meta Telemetry Channels on Ground so all Ground assets receive this as telemetry. 
             GDS will also handle ADC->mA conversion.
             This is acceptable b/c these are lower priority ("bonus") telem that we weren't counting on, so it's okay if this isn't delivered
             regularly or sometimes gets dropped. 
             Also, it's not too unreasonable to package all of these together since they're all read together at once using ADC2 Group1.</td>
