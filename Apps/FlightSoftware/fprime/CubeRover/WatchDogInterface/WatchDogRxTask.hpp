     * This is a subclass of Os::Task so that it can access the `m_handle` field of Os::Task. Os::Task was modified
     * in order to make this field protected. The `m_handle` field contains the native handle of the underlying
     * implementation of Os::Task. In our case, we expect this will always be run on the Hercules, and that the
     * underlying Os::Task implementation will be the one that is implemented using FreeRTOS. We want access to this
     * because we want to use FreeRTOS Task Notifications (https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html)
     * rather than FreeRTOS Semaphores in order to implement the task blocking and then being woken up by an
     * external trigger. We want to use Task Notifications over Semaphores because "Unblocking an RTOS task with
     * a direct notification is 45% faster and uses less RAM than unblocking a task using an intermediary
     * object such as a binary semaphore." (Source: https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html).
     * However, in order to use Task Notifications we need access to the underlying task handle, thus the
     * need for the modifications and usage described above.
