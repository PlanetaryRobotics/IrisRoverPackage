# DATA_ENCODING:
#
# In order to transmit data in a serialized format, string objects need to be encoded. Otherwise,
# it is unclear how the characters are translated into raw bytes on the wire. This value should be
# consistent with the encoding used on the flight software that is being communicated with.
#
# Traditional C/C++ strings typically use "ascii" encoding. Hence being used here.  However, should
# F prime be updated to use some other encoding, this value may be changed.
#
DATA_ENCODING = "ascii"
