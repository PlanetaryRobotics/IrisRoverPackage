ISF-MD-Profile.mdzip is a MagicDraw Profile module that contains the meta-model for the ISF software framework. Specifically it contains component and port types such as Active, Passive and Queued Components and Syncronous and Asyncronous Port types.

ISFModule.mdzip is a MagicDraw module that imports the ISF-MD-Profile and contains ISF core components such as Rate group drivers, Command dispatchers, Event loggers and Telemetry collectors. This is a module that is intended to be imported by other application models. The importer of this module will automatically get the ISF Profile and a collection of reusable ISF Core components.

In MagicDraw before loading any model, set your MagicDraw Env variable <<ISF.dir>> to the root of this ISF workspace.  Here's how it's done:
In MagicDraw:  Select Options --> Environment --> Path Variables
Add a new variable:  ISF.dir and set its value to <your_root_directory>/isf

To add a new Model: ex FatalEvent port
- Make sure you have the "System Engineer" perspective
- New SysML Project ex: Fatal
- New Package ex: Fatal
- Use Model ISF-MD-Profile
- New PortType - FatalEvent
- Create ValueProperty - Id
- Export Pkg to New Module - FatalModule.mdxml

When you “Use Model and the <ISF.dir> variable is not in the project module path:
- Project Options
- Select Module Paths and Edit the list
- Add
- Navigate to the top directory (e.g. ifs) and Choose
- In response to the question:  See the screen shot “MD Add ISF.dir”

To add a new Model by coping an existing model:
- Open an existing similar project ex: FPManager
- Copy the FPManager folder and paste
- Rename FPManager to Thermal
- Select the Thermal package, right click and Export Package to new Module
- Close existing project without saving
- Open the Thermal project
- Check that Component Plugin generates XML without any errors
