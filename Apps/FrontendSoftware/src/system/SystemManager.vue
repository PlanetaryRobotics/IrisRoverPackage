<!--
A singleton renderless Vue component containing basic functionality to setup and manage the complete (frontend+DB+backend) 
software system.

**Note:** There should only be one SystemManager instantiated on the root Component (App.vue). This class mainly exists as a 
way of streamlining the code present in the root component.

TODO: Currently doesn't do anything (LazyList autopopulate took over core functionality). Data upkeep operations will be 
added later.
