    A dictionary where each value is keyed by *both* a string name and integer ID.

    The internal principle of operation is that there is an inner dict
    (`id_dict`) mapping IDs to [VT] values and an outer dict (`name_id_mapping`)
    mapping one or more names to each ID.
    As such, multiple names can map to the same ID, though that should be done
    with some careful consideration since the meaning of the map might become
    less useful in some contexts.
    In addition, there are a lot of supporting checks to make sure this expected
    structure stays intact.
