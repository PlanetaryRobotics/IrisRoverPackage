Module IrisBackendv3.ipc.messages.m_downlinked_payloads
=======================================================
Defines the Structure, Content, and Serialization for an IPC Message
containing a group of Payloads received in the downlink direction during a read
event.

Unlike `DownlinkedPacketsMessage`, these payloads may or may not have come
**directly** from a packet (they could have also come from a MetaChannel which
generated extra payloads based on what it's read from packet payloads).

Listen for `DownlinkedPacketsMessage` and read `packet.payloads` for each
`message.content.packets` if you want just payloads that came from packets.
