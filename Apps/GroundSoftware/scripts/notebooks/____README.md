All Jupyter notebooks used for testing now reside here.

These used to be stored in the `GroundSoftware` root directory, leading to a lot of clutter. This behavior is now deprecated. The use of Jupyter notebooks in Iris GSW, in general, is now deprecated.

To run one of these legacy notebooks:
- first **copy** it into `GroundSoftware` (where it will be gitignored)
- open the notebook (e.g. in `VSCode`)
- make sure to select set the python version to `py_irisbackendv3` (from `pyenv`)
