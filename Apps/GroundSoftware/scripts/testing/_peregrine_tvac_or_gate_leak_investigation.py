"""
Quick and dirty script to investigate the backwards current leak on the OR gate
at "high" temperatures discovered during Peregrine TVAC.

NOTE: If this gives protobuf warnings, either resolve them or run:
- `PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python ./run-script.sh ...`
- instead of: `./run-script.sh ...`
