# Release Candidate 12 (RC12)
Actual release of RC12 (Oct. 23/2023 upload opportunity). Actual binaries uploaded to Iris FM1 + logs. At the time of release, this was the final in-person upload opportunity prior to the Moon and WD, Hercules, and Motor Controllers were updated. The Camera FPGA was updated during RC11 and the Radio was updated during RC6 (the only time that risky maneuver was attempted).
