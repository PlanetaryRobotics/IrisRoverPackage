# IrisRoverPackage
Complete software package for the Iris Lunar Rover (CMU).

**NOTE**: This repository used to be called `CubeRoverPackage`. For legacy reasons, the URL `https://github.com/PlanetaryRobotics/CubeRoverPackage` still works along with all its subpages. The name `CubeRoverPackage` predates the split of CubeRover and Iris Lunar Rover. This codebase is entirely unaffiliated with `CUBEROVERâ„¢`, a trademark of Astrobotic Technology.
